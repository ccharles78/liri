Movie Title: Friday
Year Released: 26 Apr 1995
IMBD Rating: 7.3
Country Produced: USA
Language: English
Plot: It is Friday and Craig Jones (Ice Cube) is unemployed, having, yesterday, been fired. He is lounging around his house with his friend Smokey (Chris Tucker), a rather incompetent weed dealer. Smokey's problem is that he tends to smoke, rather than sell, his product. This has lead to trouble with Smokey's supplier, Big Worm, who now wants his money, or his product back, or Smokey is a dead man. Then there's Deebo, the local bully, plus Craig's jealous, psychotic girlfriend, Joi, and Debbie, the neighbour Craig has a crush on. A lot can happen while lounging around your house on a Friday.
Actors: Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, Nia Long, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister
